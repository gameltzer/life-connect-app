## Meteor on FHIR 

This is the community version of Meteor on FHIR.  It is a slimmed down version that runs on AWS, Azure, Docker, and other platforms, and doesn't have binary dependencies and a lot of clutter that the older version had.  

### Running the app

meteor npm install
meteor
```

### Scripts

To lint:

```bash
meteor npm run lint
```
